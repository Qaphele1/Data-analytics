In this folder, there are some of the projects that I made which use different tools for data analysis.

The first project for data cleaning was made using Python. Pandas was imported to read the data and be able to create a datframe to work on.
Then data was cleaned to eliminate any unnecessary columns and data within the data. It also involves spliting of data which is mixed in one column. The only rows needed was that of the people who want to be contacted.

In the PowerBI project, the dataset is provided. This project was to look at different professions with their respective salaries. 
This project even focuses on male to female salary comparison within different professions to establish which gender gets paid more.
It also focuses on how happy people within the dataset are with their salaries. 
The total number of people partaking within the survey is indicated and the average age of them.
The data also takes into consideration what programming language is preferred by people.

In the project of data visualization, pandas, numpy and matplotlib were used to make the different visualizations. 
The data was first cleaned then different graphs were made to better visualize if ratings depend on texture or flavour.
